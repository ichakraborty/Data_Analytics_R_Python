But modeling churn has wide reaching applications in many domains. For example, casinos have used predictive models to predict ideal room conditions for keeping patrons at the blackjack table and when to reward unlucky gamblers with front row seats to Celine Dion. Similarly, airlines may offer first class upgrades to complaining customers. The list goes on."
